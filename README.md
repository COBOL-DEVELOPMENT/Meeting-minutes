# Meeting Minutes – As-Is Insurance Application Process

## Background
This meeting was held to review the current insurance application process
for Individual Health Insurance and to discuss why the existing workflow
needs to be improved.

At present, the entire process is still heavily paper-based, which causes
delays, errors, and unnecessary manual work across multiple departments.

## What We Looked At
During the meeting, we walked through the current (As-Is) process from
initial customer consultation to final policy issuance.

The discussion focused on how applications are collected at branches,
how customer eligibility is checked, and how underwriting and premium
calculation are handled at the head office.

## Key Issues Identified
Several common problems were repeatedly mentioned:

- Handwritten application forms often contain errors or missing information.# Meeting Minutes – As-Is Insurance Application Process

## Key Issues Identified
Several common problems were repeatedly mentioned:

- Handwritten application forms often contain errors or missing information.
- Applications are transferred by fax or mail, which slows down the process
  and sometimes results in lost or unclear documents.
- Customer verification relies on paper-based blacklist checks, making
  the process inefficient and unreliable.
- Premium confirmation is not available in real time, and customers
  typically wait several days for final results.

## Conclusion
The current As-Is process is difficult to manage and does not scale well.
Based on the discussion, there was a clear consensus that an automated
and centralized system is needed to improve accuracy, speed, and overall
operational efficiency.
